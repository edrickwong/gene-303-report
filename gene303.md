# Living in Lund

## The Introduction

### Who am I?

According to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edrickwong/), my name is Edrick and I'm a student at the University of Waterloo (although at the time of reading, I've probably graduated, hopefully...) I come from the land of Drake and Raptors, although I've spent a decent amount of time on the west coast living out the [Waterloo Dream](https://stephenholiday.com/Unofficial-Waterloo-USA-Intern-Guide/).


### What's the story?

Realizing that I haven't seen much of the world aside from Engeering 5, I decided to sign up for exchange. Being the lazy person I am, I decided to just sign up for whatever my friend did and let her handle the logistics. Third year came along and I found out that I was going to a place called [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/), a 350 year old institution in the middle of the medieval city of, well, Lund.

I remember on the first day of orientation, the coordinator say:

> You'll either fall in love with the city or with someone here, and you will
end up staying here longer than you think

which I thought was pretty funny at first, but I ended up estaying in Sweden two terms. To be quite honest, I knew nothing about Sweden aside from IKEA and ABBA,
but going this exchange has changed my perspective in life and gave me a great
opportunity ~~ culture myself ~~ to learn about Scandinavian culture.

### So what's this page?

Formally, I am supposed to write a report for my [International Studies Option](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/current-undergraduate-students/international-exchange/exchange-waterloo/international-studies-engineering-ise-option), but being a little extra I decided to make a website instead.

Informally, this website consists of random tidbits of information, insight, and some useless facts that I have accumulated in my 10 months in Lund. Hopefully, you as the reader will find interest and potentially some value in my ramblings.

### Acknowledgement

I would like to thank Julia for helping me through all the logistics and [Grace](https://graciouswho.com) for inspiring this website. I would also like to thank all the great people at the Waterloo International Office and the Lund International Office for dealing with me and making the whole thing possible.

## The Logistics

### On the Waterloo side

Applying to Lund University requires the same process as applying to any other universities on exchange. You can find out more from the [Waterloo Exchange Office](https://uwaterloo.ca/international/).

For those of you in Systems, logistically there are two ways you can schedule your exhange term.

1. You can swap your 3A coop with your 3B term, so you will be doing 2B ⇨ exchange term ⇨ 3A coop ⇨ 3B coop.
2. You can keep the normal term order.

You might be thinking, if I can keep the term order, why would I want to change terms. Well, that's a great question. There's two things to keep in mind here.

1. Semesters in Lund start a little bit earlier and end a little bit later than terms in Waterloo, so it will eat into your co-op terms.
2. The fall term at Lund is arguably  more exciting than the Winter term because of [Nollning](https://youtu.be/kUE_kOrS57Q) and the [weather](https://youtu.be/K2MGLO1OxiY)

### On the Lund side

#### Getting there

[Lund](https://goo.gl/maps/4B6eYvtr8992) is located in the southern part of Sweden.

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2247.6528541247553!2d13.206646715585581!3d55.71240570257477!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x465397cbad2f26c9%3A0xaae87ffa6a3aed7e!2sStudent+Union+LTH!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sca!4v1524271898682" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

However, if you want to reach Lund via airplane, the closest airport is actually the Copenhagen Airport (CPH), which is roughly a 40 minutes train right west in the neighbouring country of Denmark. So here are some rough instructions on getting to Lund:

1. Book a flight from wherever you are to the Copenhagen Airport (CPH)
    - Locally it is called **Kastrup**, which is handy to know if you want to travel from Lund to the airport.
2. Once you arrive at CPH, follow where everyone else is going and you should come to the train ticket area. If you are lost, ask for the train ticket area.
3. There will be a variety of machines available, both for the DSB (Danish) and the Skånetrafiken (Swedish Scanian) transit system. 
    - Both will provide a ticket that will get you to Lund, but Skånetrafiken ticket will be a smidgen cheaper.
    - These machines are most noticable red with a somewhat confusing user interface
    - Poke the British flag icon for English
    - When it asks you where you are going, you want to pick **Lund C**
    - When if asks you which method you want to cross the boards, you want to pick **Over the Bridge**
4. Go down the escalator that says **Track 1 Toward Malmø** and hop on the next available train. Just for safety, as the nice train people if this train in fact will go to Lund.
    - Make sure you have your passport and ticket ready, they will sometimes check before you get on the train and sometimes check midway through your ride.
5. Find a spot and sit in it. There should be racks above the seats and space underneath seats for you to put your stuff. 
    - Be careful to not sit in the VIP section, which is generally behind a glass door.
6. Get off at Lund C

A picture is a thousand words and a [video](https://youtu.be/rVayQBo55b8) is a thousand pictures.

If you get there on arrival day, there were will people at the airport to guide you. More up to date instructions will be delivered to you on where to pick up your keys and get shuttled to your residence. One thing to note, on arrival day, they will try to sell you things like bedsheets and dish towels for a lot of money. Purchase at your own discretion. Maybe not bedsheets, but there is a store called [TGR](http://www.lundcity.se/butik/flying-tiger/) down the street that sells a lot of everyday items for cheap.

### Being legal
Unless you are an EU citizen, you will most likely need a residence permit. Unlike the above section, I'll just leave this link [here](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/student-life/preparing-to-come/residence-permits) for instructions on how to do so. Remember to bring your passport and university acceptance letter.

On the side, there will be situations where you will be asked for a personal number, of which you will not have. Situation dependent, you might be able to provide your civic registration number, which is also your student number, but always explain your situation.

### Paying for things
Although Sweden is part of the EU, like a lot of the other Scandanavian countries, they have their own currency called Swedish krona (crown). It is often abbreviated as SEK, kr, or :-. Yeah, the last one is a colon and a hyphen. As of the time of writing, the exchange rate is roughly 1 CAD to 6.5 SEK. You will get really goot at dividing by 6 or 7.

Sweden has very strict laws when it comes to banking. Unless you have a job or are staying in Sweden for over a year, you won't be able to open a bank account. Which means, for you smarties who want to use TransferWise or XE, you probably won't be able to unless you have a really good local friend whom you trust. You might notice that locals might ask you to ['Swish'](https://www.getswish.se/) them money. Swish is similar to Venmo in the US; however, you can only use it if you have a personal number and a bank account.

So here is where you will have to gauge according on how much cash you bring versus how much you're gonna rely on your credit card. Many of the on-campus events require cash, so you will definitely need some. The beloved Lundafalafel also only accepts cash (more on this later). Almost all other stores and resturants will accept credit cards.

If you want to exchange currency, you best bet is probably the FOREX Bank, which is located near "the Big Church" behind Lundafalafel. This will also be handy to grab other currencies for travelling. Having Euros is probably the best from an exchange rate perspective, followed by USD and CAD is not too bad. One would think that you could do it at the banks, but they don't have any exchange services. In fact, the banks in Sweden don't even carry any cash in their branches. Talk about being progressive!

(Disclaimer, I'm not endorsed or affliated with any of the things I suggest, they are mostly just my personal opinion)

### Finding a place to stay
This will be covered under the Student Life section.

## The City

With the cobblestone roads, narrow streets, and a big Church, Lund embodies the feel of a medieval European city. With this, there are a couple of things to know about the city.

### Getting around

#### Bikes
Swedes really like their bikes, and in this university town, it is quite evident that this is the most preferred mode of transportation. Because travelling on bikes is such a fundamental part of Swedish culture, the infrasture is more accomodating for bikers compared to Canadian cities.

What this means for you is that you should probably get a bike; although it isn't 100% neceesary it will make life a lot of more convenient. Here are some things you should keep in mind:

- A bike is called a **cykel** in Swedish.
- Bikes are not cheap, especially in Lund because of supply and demand. Bikes will be run you anywhere from 600:- to 1200:- onwards. If you are willing to quest, you could hop my Malmö and potentially get a nicer bike for roughly the same price.
- You will legally need a front and back lights as well as a bell. You can pick them up for cheap at TGR. It is also advisable to get a good bike lock as bike theft is very common. For this, I would suggest going to a bike store and getting a proper chain. Some bikes will come with a built-in rear wheel lock.
- You *should* get a helmet but I think you will make your own observations about this. Remember, safety first!
- Bikes in Sweden have a serial number that is bounded to the owner, so if you buy used bikes, make sure you get the receipt and proper transfer of ownership.
- Within Lund, there are a number of places you can look for bikes:
    - Easiest is the Lund Facebook [buy/sell](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sblund/) pages
    - There are a number of bike shops around the city. An interesting one is [Lundaböcker](http://www.lundabocker.se/) which is normally a book store, but they also sell used bikes during special times of the year. Why I mention them is that they will also buy your bike back.
    - You can also try [Blocket](https://www.blocket.se/), which is kind of like Kijiji or Craigslist. You might need to know a little bit of Swedish just to communicate with people.

If you need repairs for your bike, which you will at least need once in your stay, there are many repair shops around campus. There is also a place called [The Bike Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/Bike-Kitchen-Lund-1614394048783886/) which offers tools and sometimes parts for free. It is also a great way to meet cool people.

You will probably notice that bikes look a little different. That is, there are a lot more Kronan styled bikes, which to be honest I prefer more.

#### Bus

The transit system in Lund is run by [Skånetrafiken](https://www.skanetrafiken.se). During the start of the school year, Skånetrafiken sometimes offers exchange students free Jojo cards, which is a reloadable card that you can use to pay for bus trips. You can refill cards at bus stations that have the red Skånetrafiken machines. Make sure you always have a little bit of money in it.

This is not something that I can endorse, but you will often time find people who offer Jojo cards with monthly passes on them, which is cheaper than individual rides if you are planning a day trip somewhere within Scania.

I think that they also have an app now that you can buy tickets.

#### Train

Depending on where you are going, there are different trains systems that you will need to be aware of. If you're travelling to a different city in Sweden, you'll most likely be using the [SJ](https://www.sj.se/en/home.html) train system. If you are going to the airport, you can refer to the arrival section.

#### Cars
Pretty uncommon and to be honest Lund is not the best city to drive around in. Parking is expensive.

#### Tram
There is supposed to be a tram that will open in 2019.

### Places to buy stuff
#### Everyday things
[Flying Tiger or TGR](https://se.flyingtiger.com/) is a great place to get everyday items. This is probably the closest thing to a dollarstore you can find.

If you need any computer related things, your best bet is probably [Teknik Magasinet](https://www.teknikmagasinet.se/).

If you're into sports, you can get equipment at the [Stadium](https://www.stadium.se/) in downtown Lund.

[Nova](http://novalund.se/) is the closest shopping centre in Lund, although there really isn't much you will need to get from here.

#### Groceries
##### Normal Supermarkets
There are a couple of different supermarket chains around the city, each with theier own unique specialties.

There most common supermarket is [ICA](https://www.ica.se/) There's a bunch of them around, including next to the train station, next to Sparta, and one up in Norra Faladen. The products are generally decently priced, although the prepacked vegetables can be a little bit on the higher end.

The second worthy mention is [Willy:s](https://www.willys.se/butik/2176). Unfortunately, there's only one in Lund, but it is definitely worth the trek. The inventory is roughly the same as ICA, with the except that they have 2 kg bags of pasta which definitely will last you a very long time. They also have their own El Dorado branded items, which is most cases is a good alternative for ther brand name equivalent.

There is also a [Lidl](https://www.lidl.se/sv/index.htm) and [Coop](https://www.coop.se/butiker-erbjudanden/stora-coop/stora-coop-lund/) in Lund. You can get big packs of random things at Lidl, and they they also sell random as-seen-on-tv things in the store. If you ever need to buy bulk things for a party, Lidl is the way to go. Coop is also another big supermarket, although it tends to be a little bit more pricey.

##### Asian Specialty Stores
If one is attentive enough to the whispers that go on, one might come across the underappreciated Asian specialty stores. There are two stores in particular that you should check out: [Asien Livs](http://www.asienlivs-travel.se/) and [Sandra Livs](http://www.lundcity.se/butik/sandralivs/). Both have miscellaneous asian specialty ingredients.

The one thing that I didn't find out until the last week in Lund was that the ICA Malborg next to the train station actually have a whole Asian section that's comparable with the two specialty stories.

### Places to eat
This comes only second to getting around because I like to eat. The resturants I list are only the one's I have visited, which is why the distribution is kind of skewed. I apologize for this. Definitely do your own exploring when you're there.

Unlike Waterloo where you might go to [Mr. Panino's](http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~m2ellis/panino/), eating out is not a common thing activity especially for broke students living off CSN (you don't have to understand what this means but you can always drop this joke with local students). Having said that, here is a few places that you should try out.

#### Student Food

The landmark of food in Lund, [Lundafalafel](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g189838-d6560590-Reviews-Lundafalafel-Lund_Skane_County.html) is a must have. In this Swedish equivalent of Campus Pizza, they offer X-stor falafelrulle (extra large falalfel wrap) for a very affordable price. A cheap place to eat at and definitely a classic. Also try out the hallumi roll, which is kind of like a secret menu item. Hallumi is amazing.

[Kårhuset](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teknologk%C3%A5ren_vid_Lunds_tekniska_h%C3%B6gskola)  translates to something along the lines of Student Union Building, but you can think of it as almost a student life building. They have a little cafeteria tucked in the corner of the second floor which offers cheap student meals. They always have a main menu and a discounted student menu. Did I mention they also have all you can eat bread, salad, and soup? My regret is I discovered this too late.

I discuss nations in the Student Life section, but most nations will have lunches for cheap. If you volunteer for nations, they may also give you free lunch tickets!

#### Swedish Food

What you can consider Swedish food is quite liberal. I go into this a bit more in the Culture section, but being of immigration and exchange of culture, Sweden has integrated a lot of different cultural foods into their own culture. One of the most important is pizzerias that serve falafel, kebob, and "pizza".

There are [many](http://www.olympialund.se/) [many](https://www.facebook.com/Tunaparkens-Pizzeria-194053327351780/) [many](http://www.ulrikedalpizzeria.com/) pizzerias around Lund but my favourite is [Delphi Pizzeria](http://www.delphipizzeria.nu/Delphi_Lund_meny_A3.pdf) mainly because I lived 5 minutes away from it. The one important thing to note is that what Swedish people consider pizza might be a little different than your idea of what a pizza is. Considering that most pizza places have over 60 different types of pizza, I'll let you figure out what it's so different.

Most traditional Swedish foods are cooked at home, so it is actually quite difficult to find places that serve these items. However, there is [one resturant](https://youtu.be/-spamtZh46Y?t=8m15s) that takes a modern spin on some classics. [Mat och Distillat](https://www.matochdestillat.se/) is a fancy resturant right across from the "Big Church" that serves comtemporary Scandanvian dishes. Bear in mind, this is probably one of those places you want to bring your date to and not visit on a regular basis. I had an amazing experience there and I would definitely recommend to try it at least once.


#### Asian Food
#####Chinese Food
Unlike Waterloo, Asian food is not quite so common in Sweden. Having said that, [Mui Gong](http://www.muigong.se/) provides most of the classics to satiate your cravings. They are also the only place in Lund (that I know of) that serves Peking duck, although you have to preorder it three days ahead.

There is a [dumpling place](http://fengssondumplingshouse.se/) tucked in a cellar somewhere near cetral Lund. I would suggest buying the frozen dumplings and cooking it yourself, but they do serve it hot too!

One of the few buffet places in Lund, [Rosegarden](https://rosegarden.se/find-us?restaurant=57106f17ad4f21090090d472) is a nice place to get your fill on "American Chinese" food. It is a buffet, so proceed at your own discretion.

##### Thai Food

[Sweet Lemon](http://www.sweet-lemon.se/) is an Thai resturant that is sort of my little secret. They're tucked behind behind some building that I always thought was a transformer station or storage unit and  open only certain days of the week, so definitely call before hand to find out where they are and see if they're available.

I'm not sure where to put [Thai Way](http://www.thaiway.se/) because along with being Thai food, it is also very student friendly. They have a number of carts all around Lund that serve student meals for cheap. The cart I normally go to is across the street from IKDC. If you can't find it, just ask around and people should be able to direct you to it.

##### Sushi
For someone who comes from Toronto or Vancouver, sushi might be a little bit different in Lund. To be honest, there are better things to eat in Lund than sushi. But if you really need to get your fix, I was suggest [Bonsai Sushi Bar](http://www.bonsai-sushi.se/). They're really tiny, so call before hand. I have heard good things about [Aiko Sushi](https://www.facebook.com/aikosushilund/) but I have never been. Some people also enjoy [Rå Epok](https://lund.raepok.com/).

##### Honourable Mentions

[Creperiet](http://www.creperiet.nu/) makes very good crepes.

[Tugg](https://www.tuggburgers.se/) makes pretty good burgers.

[Scotland Yard](http://www.fazerfoodco.se/restauranger/restauranger/scotland-yard/) is kind of like Sony's cafeteria. It's not cheap but it is technically all you can eat and the food is pretty good.

#### Bonus: Bubbletea
Doesn't exist in Sweden. Will have to travel to another country to get some. I learnt to make my own.


### Things to see
Being such a small city, there are a number of things that you should check out while you're there.

#### Lund Cathedral aka the Big Church
Domkyrka or the Lund Cathedral is a Lutheran church in the centre of downtown Lund. Two very specific things to look out for is the astronomical clock and the crypt. Also, like all old things it has a [legend](http://www.kulturportallund.se/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1008:the-legend-of-finn-the-giant&catid=540&lang=en&Itemid=4446) that goes along with it.

#### Campus
Almost all the buildings in Lund campus have something cool about them. Ones to note are:

- The main university building: self explanatory
- The main library: very good instagram location
- AF Borgen: a castle
- IKDC: an IKEA building
- Observatory: if you ask really nicely they'll let you look at the stars
- There's a bunch of museums but I'm too lazy to list them all here.

#### Botanical Gardens
There's a lot of cool plants and good place to catch Pokémon.

#### Kulturen
Probably one of the odder museums I've been it, Kulturen is an open air museam with a bunch of different buildings throughout history. Also there is a lot of exhibits into the Scandanavian lifestyle back in the days.

#### Rinnebacksravinen
A nature area where you can see cows.


## The Student Life


## The Culture

## The Language


## The Academics
The way courses are held in Lund is quite different than in Waterloo, especially for Engineering students. The information I am going to include here applies mostly to Lund's Faculty of Engineering, which is called Lunds Tekniska Högskola or LTH for short.

### Semester & Terms
First and foremost, Lund has a pseudo-quarterly system. More specifically, there are two semester, each containing two läsperioder (reading/study periods) or a total of four study periods. What this means for you is that on your exchange term, you will have roughly three courses in one study period and two in the other.

### Courses

One of my major concerns at the beginning was language. Luckily, most of the upper year courses in LTH are taught in English.

The expectations and setup of courses in Lund are quite different than that of Waterloo. At first, you might be surprised of how sparse your schedule might look. For me, my first study period consisted of lectures on Monday and Tuesday mornings (and that's not just me skipping class). However, don't let this fool you, the expectation is that you do a lot more self studying during your free time. The mentality and expectation is that students should be self-motivated in catching up with material. Unlike Waterloo where there generally is assignments to keep you on track, many of the LTH coursea are 100% finals, so you really have to keep yourself on track.

An interesting note about exams at Lund is that they almost always allocate five hours for you, regardless of whether you need it or not. You can leave whenever you want and often times you will see people eating in exams. Past exams of courses are also required to be posted, so you can find practice material fairly easily.

Another think to keep in mind is that courses are either graded on a scale of 1 to 5 (where 3+ is a pass) or courses are pass-fail. This generally works in your favour.

### Course Selection
There really isn't much to it, although one of the major things you will need to do is figure out scheduling and equivalent courses. If you are lucky, you can holler at an upper year who has been and ask what courses they took (as well as for any other advice they can give you) and base your decision off of that. 

You can find a list of courses available for exchange students [here](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/international-admissions/exchange-study-abroad/exchange-studies/find-exchange-courses). You will notice that Lund offers a very wide variety of courses, so take this opportunity to take courses that you might not otherwise be able to. Specially for exchange students, they have courses called [Special Area Studies](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/international-admissions/exchange-study-abroad/exchange-studies/special-area-studies) which covers Scandanavian and European topics. These courses are also very applicable to an International Studies Option.

### My courses


| Course                                | UW                  | LU     | Notes                                                     |

| Automatic Controls                    | SYDE 352            | FRT010 | Lab portion was only partially approved                   |
| Industrial Design                     | SYDE 362            | MMK070 | Pretty fun course                                         |
| Biomedical Signal Processing          | SYDE 544            | BMEN01 | I enjoyed it but it is very technical                     |
| Machine Learning                      | SYDE 372            | FMAN45 | No comment                                                |
| Project in Automatic Controls         | GENE 21D TE         | FRT090 | Pretty open ended                                         |
| Rehabilitation Engineering and Design | GENE 21D TE         | TNX153 | Also pretty open ended                                    |
| Swedish 1                             | GENE 22D List D CSE | EXTA24 | Det var bra                                               |
| Swedish 2                             | GENE 22D List DCSE  | EXTA25 | Det var bra också                                         |
| Health and Diet through Human History | GENE 22C List C CSE | SASH73 | One of the more esoteric courses I've taken in university |

For those of you who are in Systems, there's a couple of things to keep in mind. The lab component for Automatic Controls at Lund was only partially approved for my and moving forward it might not even be approved, due to some curriculum changes. So, you'll have to factor this into planning your schedule for forth year to make up for this. The Automatic Controls lectures are also taught in Swedish, but if you ask the professor nicely he will give you a translated copy of the lecture notes, which is more than enough to get you through the course. 

Another thing to keep in mind is that [FMNN01](http://ctr.maths.lu.se/na/courses/FMNN01/) could potentially be an equivalent to SYDE 312. However due to unforseen circumstances, I was unable to finish the course and thus cannot confirm if this course would have been accepted by the department. On the side though, the course is great and really help you develop an appreciation for linear algebra. That said, it is a 100% group oral final, and it is not an easy course.
