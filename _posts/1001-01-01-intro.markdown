### So what's the story?


During my third year of studies as a Systems Design Engineering student at the
University of Waterloo, I decided to trek to the wonderful land of Sweden for an
exchange term. More specifically, I attended a 350 year old institution in the
medieval city of Lund. I remember on the first day of orientation, the coordinator say:

> You'll either fall in love with the city or with someone here, and you will
end up staying here longer than you think

which I thought was pretty funny at first, but I ended up extending my stay for
another term. To be honest, I knew nothing about Sweden aside from IKEA and ABBA,
but going this exchange has changed my perspective in life and gave me a great
opportunity to learn about Scandinavian culture.

This website consists of random tidbits of information, insight, or absolutely
useless facts that I have accumulated in my 10 months in Lund. Hopefully, you as
the reader will find interest and potentially some value in my rambling.
