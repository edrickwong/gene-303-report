Logistically speaking, Lund is one of the easier schools to apply for. However, there are still small things that you should
be aware of.

### On the Waterloo side

Applying to Lund University requires the same process as applying to any other universities on exchange. You can find out more from the [Waterloo Exchange Office](https://uwaterloo.ca/international/).

For those of you in Systems, logistically there are two ways you can schedule your exchange term.

1. You can swap your 3A coop with your 3B term, so you will be doing 2B ⇨ exchange term ⇨ 3A coop ⇨ 3B coop.
2. You can keep the normal term order.

You might be thinking, if I can keep the term order, why would I want to change terms. Well, that's a great question. There's two things to keep in mind here.

1. Semesters in Lund start a little bit earlier and end a little bit later than terms in Waterloo, so it will eat into your co-op terms.
2. The fall term at Lund is arguably  more exciting than the Winter term because of [Nollning](https://youtu.be/kUE_kOrS57Q) and the [weather](https://youtu.be/K2MGLO1OxiY)

### On the Lund side

#### Getting there

[Lund](https://goo.gl/maps/4B6eYvtr8992) is located in the southern part of Sweden.

However, if you want to reach Lund via airplane, the closest airport is actually the Copenhagen Airport (CPH), which is roughly a 40 minutes train right west in the neighbouring country of Denmark. So here are some rough instructions on getting to Lund:

1. Book a flight from wherever you are to the Copenhagen Airport (CPH)
    - Locally it is called **Kastrup**, which is handy to know if you want to travel from Lund to the airport.
2. Once you arrive at CPH, follow where everyone else is going and you should come to the train ticket area. If you are lost, ask for the train ticket area.
3. There will be a variety of machines available, both for the DSB (Danish) and the Skånetrafiken (Swedish Scanian) transit system.
    - Both will provide a ticket that will get you to Lund, but Skånetrafiken ticket will be a smidgen cheaper.
    - These machines are most noticeable red with a somewhat confusing user interface
    - Poke the British flag icon for English
    - When it asks you where you are going, you want to pick **Lund C**
    - When if asks you which method you want to cross the boards, you want to pick **Over the Bridge**
4. Go down the escalator that says **Track 1 Toward Malmø** and hop on the next available train. Just for safety, as the nice train people if this train in fact will go to Lund.
    - Make sure you have your passport and ticket ready, they will sometimes check before you get on the train and sometimes check midway through your ride.
5. Find a spot and sit in it. There should be racks above the seats and space underneath seats for you to put your stuff.
    - Be careful to not sit in the VIP section, which is generally behind a glass door.
6. Get off at Lund C

If you get there on arrival day, there were will people at the airport to guide you. More up to date instructions will be delivered to you on where to pick up your keys and get shuttled to your residence. One thing to note, on arrival day, they will try to sell you things like bedsheets and dish towels for a lot of money. Purchase at your own discretion. Maybe not bedsheets, but there is a store called [TGR](http://www.lundcity.se/butik/flying-tiger/) down the street that sells a lot of everyday items for cheap.

### Being legal
Unless you are an EU citizen, you will most likely need a residence permit. Unlike the above section, I'll just leave this link [here](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/student-life/preparing-to-come/residence-permits) for instructions on how to do so. Remember to bring your passport and university acceptance letter.

On the side, there will be situations where you will be asked for a personal number, of which you will not have. Situation dependent, you might be able to provide your civic registration number, which is also your student number, but always explain your situation.

### Paying for things
Although Sweden is part of the EU, like a lot of the other Scandinavian countries, they have their own currency called Swedish krona (crown). It is often abbreviated as SEK, kr, or :-. Yeah, the last one is a colon and a hyphen. As of the time of writing, the exchange rate is roughly 1 CAD to 6.5 SEK. You will get really good at dividing by 6 or 7.

Sweden has very strict laws when it comes to banking. Unless you have a job or are staying in Sweden for over a year, you won't be able to open a bank account. Which means, for you smarties who want to use TransferWise or XE, you probably won't be able to unless you have a really good local friend whom you trust. You might notice that locals might ask you to ['Swish'](https://www.getswish.se/) them money. Swish is similar to Venmo in the US; however, you can only use it if you have a personal number and a bank account.

So here is where you will have to gauge according on how much cash you bring versus how much you're gonna rely on your credit card. Many of the on-campus events require cash, so you will definitely need some. The beloved Lundafalafel also only accepts cash (more on this later). Almost all other stores and restaurants will accept credit cards.

If you want to exchange currency, you best bet is probably the FOREX Bank, which is located near "the Big Church" behind Lundafalafel. This will also be handy to grab other currencies for traveling. Having Euros is probably the best from an exchange rate perspective, followed by USD and CAD is not too bad. One would think that you could do it at the banks, but they don't have any exchange services. In fact, the banks in Sweden don't even carry any cash in their branches. Talk about being progressive!
