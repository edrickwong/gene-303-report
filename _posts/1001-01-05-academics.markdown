The way courses are held in Lund is quite different than in Waterloo, especially for Engineering students. The information I am going to include here applies mostly to Lund's Faculty of Engineering, which is called Lunds Tekniska Högskola or LTH for short.

### Semester & Terms
First and foremost, Lund has a pseudo-quarterly system. More specifically, there are two semester, each containing two läsperioder (reading/study periods) or a total of four study periods. What this means for you is that on your exchange term, you will have roughly three courses in one study period and two in the other.

### Courses

One of my major concerns at the beginning was language. Luckily, most of the upper year courses in LTH are taught in English.

The expectations and setup of courses in Lund are quite different than that of Waterloo. At first, you might be surprised of how sparse your schedule might look. For me, my first study period consisted of lectures on Monday and Tuesday mornings (and that's not just me skipping class). However, don't let this fool you, the expectation is that you do a lot more self studying during your free time. The mentality and expectation is that students should be self-motivated in catching up with material. Unlike Waterloo where there generally is assignments to keep you on track, many of the LTH courses are 100% finals, so you really have to keep yourself on track.

An interesting note about exams at Lund is that they almost always allocate five hours for you, regardless of whether you need it or not. You can leave whenever you want and often times you will see people eating in exams. Past exams of courses are also required to be posted, so you can find practice material fairly easily.

Another think to keep in mind is that courses are either graded on a scale of 1 to 5 (where 3+ is a pass) or courses are pass-fail. This generally works in your favour.

### Course Selection
There really isn't much to it, although one of the major things you will need to do is figure out scheduling and equivalent courses. If you are lucky, you can holler at an upper year who has been and ask what courses they took (as well as for any other advice they can give you) and base your decision off of that.

You can find a list of courses available for exchange students [here](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/international-admissions/exchange-study-abroad/exchange-studies/find-exchange-courses). You will notice that Lund offers a very wide variety of courses, so take this opportunity to take courses that you might not otherwise be able to. Specially for exchange students, they have courses called [Special Area Studies](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/international-admissions/exchange-study-abroad/exchange-studies/special-area-studies) which covers Scandanavian and European topics. These courses are also very applicable to an International Studies Option.

| Biomedical Signal Processing          | SYDE 544            | BMEN01 | I enjoyed it but it is very technical                     |

| Rehabilitation Engineering and Design | GENE 21D TE         | TNX153 | Also pretty open ended                                    |
| Swedish 1                             | GENE 22D List D CSE | EXTA24 | Det var bra                                               |
| Swedish 2                             | GENE 22D List DCSE  | EXTA25 | Det var bra också                                         |
| Health and Diet through Human History | GENE 22C List C CSE | SASH73 | One of the more esoteric courses I've taken in university |

For those of you who are in Systems, there's a couple of things to keep in mind. The lab component for Automatic Controls at Lund was only partially approved for my and moving forward it might not even be approved, due to some curriculum changes. So, you'll have to factor this into planning your schedule for forth year to make up for this. The Automatic Controls lectures are also taught in Swedish, but if you ask the professor nicely he will give you a translated copy of the lecture notes, which is more than enough to get you through the course.

Another thing to keep in mind is that [FMNN01](http://ctr.maths.lu.se/na/courses/FMNN01/) could potentially be an equivalent to SYDE 312. However due to unforeseen circumstances, I was unable to finish the course and thus cannot confirm if this course would have been accepted by the department. On the side though, the course is great and really help you develop an appreciation for linear algebra. That said, it is a 100% group oral final, and it is not an easy course.
