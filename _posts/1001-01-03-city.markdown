With the cobblestone roads, narrow streets, and a big Church, Lund embodies the feel of a medieval European city. With this, there are a couple of things to know about the city.

### Getting around

#### Bikes
Swedes really like their bikes, and in this university town, it is quite evident that this is the most preferred mode of transportation. Because travelling on bikes is such a fundamental part of Swedish culture, the infrasture is more accomodating for bikers compared to Canadian cities.

What this means for you is that you should probably get a bike; although it isn't 100% neceesary it will make life a lot of more convenient. Here are some things you should keep in mind:

- A bike is called a **cykel** in Swedish.
- Bikes are not cheap, especially in Lund because of supply and demand. Bikes will be run you anywhere from 600:- to 1200:- onwards. If you are willing to quest, you could hop my Malmö and potentially get a nicer bike for roughly the same price.
- You will legally need a front and back lights as well as a bell. You can pick them up for cheap at TGR. It is also advisable to get a good bike lock as bike theft is very common. For this, I would suggest going to a bike store and getting a proper chain. Some bikes will come with a built-in rear wheel lock.
- You *should* get a helmet but I think you will make your own observations about this. Remember, safety first!
- Bikes in Sweden have a serial number that is bounded to the owner, so if you buy used bikes, make sure you get the receipt and proper transfer of ownership.
- Within Lund, there are a number of places you can look for bikes:
    - Easiest is the Lund Facebook [buy/sell](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sblund/) pages
    - There are a number of bike shops around the city. An interesting one is [Lundaböcker](http://www.lundabocker.se/) which is normally a book store, but they also sell used bikes during special times of the year. Why I mention them is that they will also buy your bike back.
    - You can also try [Blocket](https://www.blocket.se/), which is kind of like Kijiji or Craigslist. You might need to know a little bit of Swedish just to communicate with people.

If you need repairs for your bike, which you will at least need once in your stay, there are many repair shops around campus. There is also a place called [The Bike Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/Bike-Kitchen-Lund-1614394048783886/) which offers tools and sometimes parts for free. It is also a great way to meet cool people.

You will probably notice that bikes look a little different. That is, there are a lot more Kronan styled bikes, which to be honest I prefer more.

#### Bus

The transit system in Lund is run by [Skånetrafiken](https://www.skanetrafiken.se). During the start of the school year, Skånetrafiken sometimes offers exchange students free Jojo cards, which is a reloadable card that you can use to pay for bus trips. You can refill cards at bus stations that have the red Skånetrafiken machines. Make sure you always have a little bit of money in it.

This is not something that I can endorse, but you will often time find people who offer Jojo cards with monthly passes on them, which is cheaper than individual rides if you are planning a day trip somewhere within Scania.

I think that they also have an app now that you can buy tickets.

#### Train

Depending on where you are going, there are different trains systems that you will need to be aware of. If you're travelling to a different city in Sweden, you'll most likely be using the [SJ](https://www.sj.se/en/home.html) train system. If you are going to the airport, you can refer to the arrival section.

#### Cars
Pretty uncommon and to be honest Lund is not the best city to drive around in. Parking is expensive.

#### Tram
There is supposed to be a tram that will open in 2019.

### Places to buy stuff
#### Everyday things
[Flying Tiger or TGR](https://se.flyingtiger.com/) is a great place to get everyday items. This is probably the closest thing to a dollarstore you can find.

If you need any computer related things, your best bet is probably [Teknik Magasinet](https://www.teknikmagasinet.se/).

If you're into sports, you can get equipment at the [Stadium](https://www.stadium.se/) in downtown Lund.

[Nova](http://novalund.se/) is the closest shopping centre in Lund, although there really isn't much you will need to get from here.

#### Groceries
##### Normal Supermarkets
There are a couple of different supermarket chains around the city, each with their own unique specialties.

There most common supermarket is [ICA](https://www.ica.se/) There's a bunch of them around, including next to the train station, next to Sparta, and one up in Norra Faladen. The products are generally decently priced, although the prepackaged vegetables can be a little bit on the higher end.

The second worthy mention is [Willy:s](https://www.willys.se/butik/2176). Unfortunately, there's only one in Lund, but it is definitely worth the trek. The inventory is roughly the same as ICA, with the except that they have 2 kg bags of pasta which definitely will last you a very long time. They also have their own El Dorado branded items, which is most cases is a good alternative for ther brand name equivalent.

There is also a [Lidl](https://www.lidl.se/sv/index.htm) and [Coop](https://www.coop.se/butiker-erbjudanden/stora-coop/stora-coop-lund/) in Lund. You can get big packs of random things at Lidl, and they they also sell random as-seen-on-tv things in the store. If you ever need to buy bulk things for a party, Lidl is the way to go. Coop is also another big supermarket, although it tends to be a little bit more pricey.

##### Asian Specialty Stores
If one is attentive enough to the whispers that go on, one might come across the underappreciated Asian specialty stores. There are two stores in particular that you should check out: [Asien Livs](http://www.asienlivs-travel.se/) and [Sandra Livs](http://www.lundcity.se/butik/sandralivs/). Both have miscellaneous asian specialty ingredients.

The one thing that I didn't find out until the last week in Lund was that the ICA Malborg next to the train station actually have a whole Asian section that's comparable with the two specialty stories.

### Places to eat
This comes only second to getting around because I like to eat. The restaurants I list are only the one's I have visited, which is why the distribution is kind of skewed. I apologize for this. Definitely do your own exploring when you're there.

Unlike Waterloo where you might go to [Mr. Panino's](http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~m2ellis/panino/), eating out is not a common thing activity especially for broke students living off CSN (you don't have to understand what this means but you can always drop this joke with local students). Having said that, here is a few places that you should try out.

#### Student Food

The landmark of food in Lund, [Lundafalafel](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g189838-d6560590-Reviews-Lundafalafel-Lund_Skane_County.html) is a must have. In this Swedish equivalent of Campus Pizza, they offer X-stor falafelrulle (extra large falalfel wrap) for a very affordable price. A cheap place to eat at and definitely a classic. Also try out the hallumi roll, which is kind of like a secret menu item. Hallumi is amazing.

[Kårhuset](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teknologk%C3%A5ren_vid_Lunds_tekniska_h%C3%B6gskola)  translates to something along the lines of Student Union Building, but you can think of it as almost a student life building. They have a little cafeteria tucked in the corner of the second floor which offers cheap student meals. They always have a main menu and a discounted student menu. Did I mention they also have all you can eat bread, salad, and soup? My regret is I discovered this too late.

I discuss nations in the Student Life section, but most nations will have lunches for cheap. If you volunteer for nations, they may also give you free lunch tickets!

#### Swedish Food

What you can consider Swedish food is quite liberal. I go into this a bit more in the Culture section, but being of immigration and exchange of culture, Sweden has integrated a lot of different cultural foods into their own culture. One of the most important is pizzerias that serve falafel, kebob, and "pizza".

There are [many](http://www.olympialund.se/) [many](https://www.facebook.com/Tunaparkens-Pizzeria-194053327351780/) [many](http://www.ulrikedalpizzeria.com/) pizzerias around Lund but my favourite is [Delphi Pizzeria](http://www.delphipizzeria.nu/Delphi_Lund_meny_A3.pdf) mainly because I lived 5 minutes away from it. The one important thing to note is that what Swedish people consider pizza might be a little different than your idea of what a pizza is. Considering that most pizza places have over 60 different types of pizza, I'll let you figure out what it's so different.

Most traditional Swedish foods are cooked at home, so it is actually quite difficult to find places that serve these items. However, there is [one restaurant](https://youtu.be/-spamtZh46Y?t=8m15s) that takes a modern spin on some classics. [Mat och Distillat](https://www.matochdestillat.se/) is a fancy restaurant right across from the "Big Church" that serves comtemporary Scandanvian dishes. Bear in mind, this is probably one of those places you want to bring your date to and not visit on a regular basis. I had an amazing experience there and I would definitely recommend to try it at least once.


#### Asian Food
##### Chinese Food
Unlike Waterloo, Asian food is not quite so common in Sweden. Having said that, [Mui Gong](http://www.muigong.se/) provides most of the classics to satiate your cravings. They are also the only place in Lund (that I know of) that serves Peking duck, although you have to preorder it three days ahead.

There is a [dumpling place](http://fengssondumplingshouse.se/) tucked in a cellar somewhere near central Lund. I would suggest buying the frozen dumplings and cooking it yourself, but they do serve it hot too!

One of the few buffet places in Lund, [Rosegarden](https://rosegarden.se/find-us?restaurant=57106f17ad4f21090090d472) is a nice place to get your fill on "American Chinese" food. It is a buffet, so proceed at your own discretion.

##### Thai Food

[Sweet Lemon](http://www.sweet-lemon.se/) is an Thai restaurant that is sort of my little secret. They're tucked behind behind some building that I always thought was a transformer station or storage unit and  open only certain days of the week, so definitely call before hand to find out where they are and see if they're available.

I'm not sure where to put [Thai Way](http://www.thaiway.se/) because along with being Thai food, it is also very student friendly. They have a number of carts all around Lund that serve student meals for cheap. The cart I normally go to is across the street from IKDC. If you can't find it, just ask around and people should be able to direct you to it.

##### Sushi
For someone who comes from Toronto or Vancouver, sushi might be a little bit different in Lund. To be honest, there are better things to eat in Lund than sushi. But if you really need to get your fix, I was suggest [Bonsai Sushi Bar](http://www.bonsai-sushi.se/). They're really tiny, so call before hand. I have heard good things about [Aiko Sushi](https://www.facebook.com/aikosushilund/) but I have never been. Some people also enjoy [Rå Epok](https://lund.raepok.com/).

##### Honourable Mentions

[Creperiet](http://www.creperiet.nu/) makes very good crepes.

[Tugg](https://www.tuggburgers.se/) makes pretty good burgers.

[Scotland Yard](http://www.fazerfoodco.se/restauranger/restauranger/scotland-yard/) is kind of like Sony's cafeteria. It's not cheap but it is technically all you can eat and the food is pretty good.

#### Bonus: Bubbletea
Doesn't exist in Sweden. Will have to travel to another country to get some. I learnt to make my own.


### Things to see
Being such a small city, there are a number of things that you should check out while you're there.

#### Lund Cathedral aka the Big Church
Domkyrka or the Lund Cathedral is a Lutheran church in the centre of downtown Lund. Two very specific things to look out for is the astronomical clock and the crypt. Also, like all old things it has a [legend](http://www.kulturportallund.se/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1008:the-legend-of-finn-the-giant&catid=540&lang=en&Itemid=4446) that goes along with it.

#### Campus
Almost all the buildings in Lund campus have something cool about them. Ones to note are:

- The main university building: self explanatory
- The main library: very good instagram location
- AF Borgen: a castle
- IKDC: an IKEA building
- Observatory: if you ask really nicely they'll let you look at the stars
- There's a bunch of museums but I'm too lazy to list them all here.

#### Botanical Gardens
There's a lot of cool plants and good place to catch Pokémon.

#### Kulturen
Probably one of the odder museums I've been it, Kulturen is an open air museum with a bunch of different buildings throughout history. Also there is a lot of exhibits into the Scandinavian lifestyle back in the days.

#### Rinnebacksravinen
A nature area where you can see cows.
